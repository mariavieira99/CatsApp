## Hybrid Data Fetching

- The app follows a **hybrid architecture**, combining **network** and **local database (Room)** sources for a balance between responsiveness and offline support.
- On **first launch** (or when Room is empty), cat data is fetched from the Cats API on endpoint - https://api.thecatapi.com/v1/breeds. The response is **saved to Room**.
- **Subsequent reads** are served from Room, not the network.
- This improves performance and resilience to network issues.

## Periodic Sync

- In order to keep the data update while the user is active (app is opened), there is a job running and every 5 minutes it will fetch the latest data and updates the room database and UI in case there were any changes. A 5-minute sync interval ensures the data stays up-to-date with minimal network usage, providing a fresh user experience without overwhelming the system with frequent updates.

## Internet-Aware Syncing

- If the device goes offline, the periodic sync job is cancelled. When comes back online, the app automatically triggers a sync and fetches the updated data from the CatsAPI and updates the room database and UI in case there were any changes. This ensures up-to-date content even after a connection loss.

## Favorites: Network as Source of Truth

- Favorites are managed by the backend (CatsAPI) â€” all add/remove actions are performed via API requests.
- The app stores the favorite state locally in the Room database using a flag on the CatModel entity. This enables instant UI updates and consistent state across screens.
- Since the backend is the single source of truth, the user cannot modify favorites while offline. This avoids sync conflicts and ensures that local data always matches the server.
